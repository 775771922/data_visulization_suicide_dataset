# data_visulization_suicide_dataset
Suicide dataset from 1985 to 2016
This project is part of the university of edinburgh "Data visualization" project, In this project, we do some basic visualization to help our 
audience, the policy makers, have a better understanding of the suicides in the world.

Many thanks to my classmate Pengyou Guo, Shanen and Vincent who made a lot of efforts on this project.
